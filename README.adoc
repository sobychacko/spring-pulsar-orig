# Spring for Apache Pulsar

This project provides a basic Spring friendly API for developing https://pulsar.apache.org/[Apache Pulsar] applications.

Most of the ideas in this project are borrowed from the Spring for Apache Kafka project, thus a familiarity with the Spring support available in Spring for Apache Kafka would help a lot.


** #IMPORTANT#: This is a WIP project. Many of the support available at the moment are prototypes and experimental.

## Quick Introduction

The current prototype supports a basic `PulsarTemplate` for publishing to a Pulsar topic, `PulsarListner` annotation for consuming from a topic.
It also provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for these components.

### Writing a quick Spring Boot based Pulsar application.

Let's take a look at the application below.
This captures the current support available for publishing to and consuming from a Pulsar topic.

```
@SpringBootApplication
public class PulsarBootApp {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		SpringApplication.run(PulsarBootApp.class, args);
	}

	@Bean
	public ApplicationRunner runner(PulsarTemplate<String> pulsarTemplate) {
		pulsarTemplate.setDefaultTopicName("hello-pulsar-exclusive");
		return args -> {
			for (int i = 0; i < 100; i ++) {
				pulsarTemplate.send("This is message " + (i + 1));
			}

		};
	}

	@PulsarListener(subscriptionName = "test-exclusive-sub", topics = "hello-pulsar-exclusive")
	public void listen(String foo) {
		System.out.println("Message Received: " + foo);
	}
}
```

This is a complete Spring Boot application that is sending messages to a topic in Apache Pulsar and consuming from that topic.

`PulsarTemplate` is the template mechanism available in Spring for Apache Pulsar that enables you to publish messages to a topic.
The project provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for this `PulsarTemplate` which we inject in the application above.

We use `PulsarListener` annotation to consume from the same topic where the template is publishing to.

At the moment, we only support the `Exclusive` subscription mode. 

### Building the project

```
./gradlew clean build
```

### More support to come -- stay tuned...
